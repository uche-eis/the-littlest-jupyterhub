**The Littlest JupyterHub** (TLJH) distribution helps you provide Jupyter Notebooks
to 1-100 users on a single server.

The primary audience are people who do not consider themselves 'system administrators'
but would like to provide hosted Jupyter Notebooks for their students or users.
All users are provided with the same environment, and administrators
can easily install libraries into this environment without any specialized knowledge.

See the `latest documentation <https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io>`_
for more information on using The Littlest JupyterHub.

For support questions please search or post to `our forum <https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/jupyterhub/>`_.

Development Status
==================

This project is currently in **beta** state. Folks have been using installations
of TLJH for more than a year now to great success. While we try hard not to, we
might still make breaking changes that have no clear upgrade pathway.

Installation
============

The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH) requires at least Python 3.6. This fork allows you
to specify your Python install. If you're running Ubuntu prior to 18.04 you'll
have to install a more up-to-date Python and set its executable path in the
environment as TLJH_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE.

We have several tutorials to get you started.

- Tutorials to create a new server from scratch on a cloud provider & run TLJH
  on it. These are **recommended** if you do not have much experience setting up
  servers.

  - `OVH <https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/ovh.html>`_
  - `Google Cloud <https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/google.html>`_
  - `Jetstream <https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/jetstream.html>`_
  - `Amazon Web Services <https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/amazon.html>`_
  - `Microsoft Azure <https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/azure.html>`_
  - ... your favorite provider here, if you can contribute!

- `Tutorial to install TLJH on an already running server you have root access to
  <https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/custom-server.html>`_.
  You should use this if your cloud provider does not already have a direct tutorial,
  or if you have experience setting up servers.

Documentation
=============

Our latest documentation is at: https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io

We place a high importance on consistency, readability and completeness of
documentation. If a feature is not documented, it does not exist. If a behavior
is not documented, it is a bug! We try to treat our documentation like we treat
our code: we aim to improve it as often as possible.

If something is confusing to you in the documentation, it is a bug. We would be
happy if you could `file an issue
<https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/issues>`_ about it - or
even better, `contribute a documentation fix
<http://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/docs.html>`_!
